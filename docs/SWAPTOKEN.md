## How we get revenue

- By selling [Wordpress plugin](https://codecanyon.net/item/multicurrency-crypto-wallet-and-exchange-widgets-for-wordpress/23532064) (whitelabel, wallet as a service)
- By custom MultiCurrencyWallet integrations
- By [community donations](/docs/DONATE.md)

## Initial selling strategy
- swaponline team can sell SWAP tokens not less than 1 USD per 1 SWAP (please don't buy tokens above 1 usd anywhere to prevent getting rekt)
- By default, funds are used to support liquidity (not a price increase!) but can be managed by CEO
